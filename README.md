Hi! I'm Yatharth Singh (often known as _lefteryx_ on the internet), a CS Freshman at BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus.

I just waste a lot of time on the internet and can follow instructions (which I've been told is the _Sigma Developer Grindset_).
Besides being a terminally online nerd, I like playing the keyboard, playing table tennis, quizzing, watching cat videos and playing CSGO with Russians.

I'm currently excitedly exploring different domains including, but not limited to, Machine Learning, App Development, Back-end Development and Competitive Programming.

I can be contacted via email at _lft@duck.com_ and [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/yath). 
I can also be found lurking on [Telegram](t.me/lftryx) (_@lftryx_) and [Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/golu_molu_bacha) (_@golu_molu_bacha_).
